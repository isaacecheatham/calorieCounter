# calorieCounter

The calorie counter program is a simple PHP program that was created for a school project. It's a little rough around the edges but I learned a good mout of PHP in the process.

If you want to setup the program your self you will need to have PHP installed and MySQL. 

1. Download all the project files.
2. Create a database named "calorie_counter" if you don't wish to update the connection strings.
3. Run the "calorie_counter.sql" file to create the tables in the database with all necessary parameters. 
4. Update the connection strings in "connect.php", "login.php", and "session.php" with your MySQL username and password. 
5. Once you start the server the app should run and you can create your account.

Database Name: calorie_counter
